# Bioinformatics Pipelines 
Projects developed for STAT530: Bioinformatics, showcasing a range of genomic data analysis techniques using Python and R.

This repository contains standalone pipelines for tasks such as dimensionality reduction, clustering, and differential gene expression analysis — all using real-world biological datasets.
